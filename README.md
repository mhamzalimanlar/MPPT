MPPT  (Maximum Power Point Tracking) Solar Charg Control Device 

This project involves the design of a PCB using the Altium Designer program. The board includes a TLP152 optocoupler, three 1N4148 bridge diodes, and an LCD display, which is controlled by an Arduino Nano module. The purpose of this project is to increase the current from the solar panels by reducing the high voltage. This will allow for more current to be used from the solar panels and for the 12V solar cells to be charged in a shorter time due to the increasedÂ current.
