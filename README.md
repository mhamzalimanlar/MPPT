MPPT  (Maximum Power Point Tracking) Solar Charg Control Device 
With this project, one pieces TLP152 optocoupler, 3 1N4148 bridge diodes, one LCD Display, controlled by arduino nano module, a PCB was designed using the Altium Designer program in order to increase the current by reducing the high voltage from the solar panels, so that more current can be used from the solar panels and the 12V solar cells can be charged in a shorter time with the increase in current.
